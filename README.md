# Tutoring Chatbot

## Overview
The Tutoring Chatbot is designed to help students learn topics for their classes interactively. Students can specify the topic they want to learn, and the chatbot will guide them through lessons and practice questions based on their skill level. Teachers can also create classrooms, customizing the chatbot's behavior and what information is revealed to the students.

This project is a prototype intended to support subjects such as math, science, and reading. The chatbot will provide both explanations and quizzes, withholding answers from the student until the questions are answered, ensuring an interactive and effective learning experience.

## Planned Features
- **Interactive Learning**: The chatbot responds to students' requests and provides lessons or explanations on math.
- **Testing Mode**: The chatbot quizzes students on topics, withholding answers until they respond correctly, allowing for active learning.
- **Skill-Level Adjustments**: The chatbot tailors the level of questions and explanations based on the student’s proficiency.

## Project Scope
The Tutoring Chatbot prototype will feature the following:
- **Math Topics**: The chatbot will support learning materials for math.
- **Test Mode**: Students will be quizzed, and answers will be hidden until they provide a correct answer. 
- **User Roles**:
  - **Student**: Can interact with the chatbot to learn about topics and take quizzes.
  - **Teacher**: Can create and edit classrooms and adjust the chatbot’s behavior.
